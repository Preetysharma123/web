<h1>Movie descripation</h1>
<p><h1>My favourite movie is Shararat is a 2002 hindi comedy drama movie directed by debutant Gurudev Bhalla, statrring Abhishek Bachhan,Hrishitaa Bhatt and Amrish Puri.</h1><h2> This film was released on 12 july 2002. In this movie Rahul khanna is the only son of wealthy industrialists, who have no time for their son while on the other hand Rahul has nothing but time on his hands and is hell bent upon getting into trouble with the law, such as racing cars with his friends but he gets away with it most of the his friends but he gets away with it most of the time by bribing the officer.</h2><h3>Eventually his luck runs out one day while stuck in traffic and in a hurry to reach the airport for his flight to America he meddles with the traffic lights turning them all green casuing a number of vehicles to crash. This time the offence is too serious and unable to bribe the officer he is arrested. DCP Bhosle waants to teach Rahul a lesson but can't think of a way other than making him do time in jail.
    </h3><h4>Neha Sengupta inspired by a Bill Clinton newspaper article, comes up with a unique punishment idea for Rahul, Community service.</h4>
    <h5>The Judge likes this idea and sentences a remorseless Rahul to a senior citizen's home out in the country. Sparks fly when rahul meets the old residents of the senior citizens' home, as they do not get on very well.</p>
   <h6>moral:- In this movie convert a selfish man into a carefull person to other.</h6>
